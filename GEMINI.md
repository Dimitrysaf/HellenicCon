The `NavBar.tsx` component implements a responsive navigation bar using Material-UI. It features a fixed `AppBar` at the top. For desktop views, it includes a permanent `Drawer` on the left side with a fixed width of 240px, which is hidden on mobile. The `AppBar` contains a custom `Icon` component and a `Typography` element for the main title "ΤΟ ΣΥΝΤΑΓΜΑ ΤΗΣ ΕΛΛΑΔΟΣ", which is also hidden on mobile. For mobile views, there's an `IconButton` with a `MenuIcon` to potentially open a mobile menu (though the mobile menu drawer itself is not fully implemented in the provided code snippet). The `Drawer` contains a `List` of navigation items, currently "ΣΥΝΤΑΓΜΑ" and "ΘΕΜΑΤΑ", each with an icon (`AccountBalanceIcon` or `ChatBubbleIcon`) and text. The `AppBar`'s `zIndex` is set to be above the drawer.
